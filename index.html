				<p>Plastic is now a real-world issue, and we must all take notice. According to <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/what-we-do/oceans/plastics/" target="blank">Greenpeace</a>, an estimated 12.7 million tonnes of plastic (including plastic bottles, bags, packaging, etc) end up in our oceans each year.</p>

				<p>Every single one of us has the responsibility of fighting plastic pollution, and it starts with our own use of it. There are a variety of ways that this can be done: shopping from local markets or farm shops, or by signing up to a vegetable box subscription. However this is not always possible, and most of us still rely heavily on big supermarket chains for most of our groceries. With this in mind, I decided to start a shopping list to rate the eco-friendlieness of the packaging of products.</p>

				<h2>How to use the list</h2>
			<div class="col4 colr">
				<img class="icon" src="img/uselist.svg">
			</div>
			<div class="col8">	<p>At the moment, the shopping list is just a big spreadsheet, and most of the items are from British supermarkets. However hopefully it will keep expanding in the next weeks and months as more of you contribute. You can take a look, open it up on your smartphone when you go shopping, and find the products with the most sustainable packaging.</p>
				<p>There are two main ways of using the list:
					<ul>
						<li>If you already know what you want to buy, you can check its package rating before purchasing it by searching for that specific item;</li>
						<li>If you need something from a category (i.e. "rice"), you can filter the items by that category and check what's the best product within it.</li>

				<h2>How to read the list</h2>
			<div class="col4">
				<img class="icon" src="img/list.svg">
			</div>
			<div class="col8">	<p>Reading the list is very simple. For each item you will find:
					<ul>
						<li>Category: is it fruit, pasta, shampoo, etc?</li>
						<li>Name of brand and product</li>
						<li>Green rating, which goes from 1 to 3 (1 being very ecofriendly and 3 being to avoid)</li>
						<li>Description of what the packaging is like</li>
						<li>Some items might also have some extra information, such as price, country it was recorded in and barcode.</li>

				<p>The list is based on crowdsourcing, so we need your help to keep it growing!
					You can contribute to the list by creating a new item, or by amending an existing one. You can do so through our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScI8VD5JGY9MkPvi6EZ63hLDxe4bwJS_kKHnXl7slj1tSsJfQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target:"blank">online survey</a>.</p>
				<p>Although the list was born in the UK and most of the products listed are British, you can add other items too from other countries.</p>
				<p>Once we develop a big enough database, we will then start building an app to allow you to scan barcodes when you shop to automatically get suggestions on how to shop more sustainably.</p>
